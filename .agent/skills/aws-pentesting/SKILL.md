# AWS Pentesting Skill

This skill provides a framework for authorized security testing of AWS environments.

> Only run these checks if the user has explicitly requested and authorized a pentest on a specific account.

## Workflow
1.  **Scope**: Define the target (ARN, IP, VPC).
2.  **Recon**:
    *   List buckets: `aws s3 ls` (Check for public buckets).
    *   Check Security Groups: Open ports 22, 3389, 0.0.0.0/0.
    *   IAM: Check for `*:*` permissions or over-privileged roles.
3.  **Analysis**:
    *   Look for hardcoded credentials in UserData.
    *   Check for unencrypted EBS volumes.

## Safety
*   NEVER modify or delete resources.
*   Only READ configuration state.
